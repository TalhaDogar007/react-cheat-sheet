useCallback is a React hook used for memoizing functions. In React, when a component re-renders, functions defined within it are recreated. This can cause unnecessary re-renders in child components that receive these functions as props because they are treated as new references on each render. useCallback allows you to memoize a function so that it is only recreated if its dependencies change. This can optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
