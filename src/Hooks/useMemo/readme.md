useMemo is a React hook used for memoizing expensive calculations in functional components. It allows you to optimize performance by memoizing the result of a function or a computation so that it is only recalculated when its dependencies change. This is particularly useful when you have a computation that is costly in terms of CPU or memory and doesn't need to be recalculated on every render.
